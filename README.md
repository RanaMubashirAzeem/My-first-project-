This is my very first project on GitHub! I built a clone of the classic Flappy Bird game to practice my coding skills and learn the basics of game physics and collision detection.
​🕹️ How to Play
​Action: Press the Spacebar (or click/tap) to make the bird flap.
​Goal: Navigate through the gaps between the pipes without touching them.
​Score: Earn 1 point for every pipe you pass. The game ends if you hit a pipe or the ground.
​✨ Key Features
​Gravity Physics: Realistic falling and jumping movement.
​Randomized Pipes: Pipes spawn at different heights for a constant challenge.
​Score Tracker: Real-time scoring system.
​Game Over State: Restart functionality once the bird crashes.
